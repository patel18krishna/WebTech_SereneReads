              Khalifa was twenty-six years old when he met the merchant Amur
              Biashara. At the time he was working for a small private bank
              owned by two Gujarati brothers. The Indian-run private banks were
              the only ones that had dealings with local merchants and
              accommodated themselves to their ways of doing business. The big
              banks wanted business run by paperwork and securities and
              guarantees, which did not always suit local merchants who worked
              on networks and associations invisible to the naked eye. The
              brothers employed Khalifa because he was related to them on his
              father's side. Perhaps related was too strong a word but his
              father was from Gujarat too and in some instances that was
              relation enough. His mother was a countrywoman. Khalifa's father
              met her when he was working on the farm of a big Indian land
              owner, two days' journey from the town, where he stayed for most
              of his adult life. Khalifa did not look Indian, or not the kind of
              Indian they were used to seeing in that part of the world. His
              complexion, his hair, his nose, all favoured his African mother
              but he loved to announce his lineage when it suited him. Yes, yes,
              my father was an Indian. I don't look it, hey? He married my
              mother and stayed loyal to her. Some Indian men play around with
              African women until they are ready to send for an Indian wife then
              abandon them. My father never left my mother.

              His father's name was Qassim and he was born in a small village in
              Gujarat which had its rich and its poor, its Hindus and its
              Muslims and even some Hubshi Christians. Qassim's family was
              Muslim and poor. He grew up a diligent boy who was used to
              hardship. He was sent to a mosque school in his village and then
              to a Gujarati-speaking government school in the town near his
              home. His own father was a tax collector who travelled the
              countryside for his employer, and it was his idea that Qassim
              should be sent to school so that he too could become a tax col-
              lector or something similarly respectable. His father did not live
              with them. He only ever came to see them two or three times in a
              year. Qassim's mother looked after her blind mother-in-law as well
              as five children. He was the eldest and he had a younger brother
              and three sisters. Two of his sisters, the two youngest, died when
              they were small. Their father sent money now and then but they had
              to look after themselves in the village and do whatever work they
              could find. When Qassim was old enough, his teachers at the
              Gujarati-speaking school encouraged him to sit for a scholarship
              at an elementary English-medium school in Bombay, and after that
              his luck began to change. His father and other relatives arranged
              a loan to allow him to lodge as best he could in Bombay while he
              attended the school. In time his situ- ation improved because he
              came a lodger with the family of a school friend, who also helped
              him to find work as a tutor of younger children. The few annas he
              earned there helped him to support himself.

              Soon after he finished school, an offer came for him to join a
              landowner's book-keeping team on the coast of Africa. It seemed
              like a blessing, opening a door to a livelihood for him and per-
              haps some adventure. The offer came through the imam of his home
              village. The landowner's antecedents came from the same village in
              the distant past, and they always sent for a book-keeper from
              there when they needed one. It was to ensure someone loyal and
              dependent was looking after their affairs. Every year during the
              fasting month Qassim sent to the imam of his home village a sum of
              money, which the landowner kept aside from his wages, to pass on
              to his family. He never returned to Gujarat.

              That was the story Khalifa's father told him about his own
              struggles as a child. He told him because that is what fathers do
              to their children and because he wanted the boy to want more. He
              taught him to read and write in the roman alphabet and to
              understand the basics of arithmetic. Then when Khalifa was a
              little older, about eleven or so, he sent the boy to a private
              tutor in the nearby town who taught him mathematics and
              book-keeping and an elementary English vocabulary. These were
              ambitions and practices his father had brought with him from
              India, but which were unfulfilled in his own life.

              Khalifa was not the tutor's only student. There were four of them,
              all Indian boys. They lodged with their teacher, sleeping on the
              floor in the downstairs hallway under the stairs where they also
              had their meals. They were never allowed upstairs. Their classroom
              was a small room with mats on the floor and a high barred window,
              too high for them to see out although they could smell the open
              drain running past the back of the house. Their tutor kept the
              room locked after lessons and treated it as a sacred space, which
              they must sweep and dust every morning before lessons began. They
              had lessons first thing and then again in the late afternoon
              before it became too dark. In the early afternoon, after his
              lunch, the tutor always went to sleep, and they did not have
              lessons in the evening to save on candles. In the hours that were
              their own they found work in the market or on the shore or else
              wandered the streets. Khalifa did not suspect
